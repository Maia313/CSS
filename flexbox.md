## Flexbox

> You start by having a container and child divs
>
```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; // by default, more common
  justify-content: flex-start; // by default
}
```

### Axis

> 

#### Main axis
> By default it is horizontal
>
> It goes from left to right along the row

#### Cross axis
> Is vertical
>
> It goes from top to bottom along the column
