### Layout rules
-----

>There are *inline* and *block* elements in CSS normal flow.
>The relative positioning of *block* and *inline* elements is not actually determined by the element's display property! It's actually determined by the formatting context, which is influenced by the siblings of the element.

>*z-index* is not absolute across the document, but rather relative to a stacking context

>There are in fact at least 5 different box models, with subtle differences in how content dimensions and **margin: auto** are treated
