> To make an image responsive to the container it is in, you will set the width to 100%. The following is a basic CSS example to make your images responsive:
```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

```css
/* Change all elements to use border-box */
html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
    box-sizing: inherit;
}

```
